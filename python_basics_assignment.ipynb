    "\n",
    "**1. What is Python, and why is it popular?**  \n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It’s popular because of its rich library support, versatility across domains (web, data science, AI, automation), and a huge developer community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is an interpreter in Python?**  \n",
    "An interpreter executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine code on the fly. This makes debugging easier but can be slower than compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**  \n",
    "Reserved words with special meaning in Python syntax, like `if`, `for`, `class`. They cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Can keywords be used as variable names?**  \n",
    "No — Python will throw a `SyntaxError` if you try.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What is mutability in Python?**  \n",
    "Mutability is the ability of an object to be changed after creation. Lists, sets, and dicts are mutable; strings, tuples, and integers are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**  \n",
    "Lists store references in a resizable structure, allowing changes in place. Tuples are fixed-size and store immutable references to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Difference between `==` and `is` operators in Python?**  \n",
    "- **`==`** → Compares values/content.  \n",
    "- **`is`** → Compares object identity (memory location).\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. What are logical operators in Python?**  \n",
    "- **`and`** – Returns `True` if both conditions are true.  \n",
    "- **`or`** – Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.  \n",
    "- **`not`** – Inverts a boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. What is type casting in Python?**  \n",
    "Changing an object’s data type using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**  \n",
    "- **Implicit** – Done automatically by Python (e.g., `int + float → float`).  \n",
    "- **Explicit** – Done manually using functions like `int()` or `float()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Purpose of conditional statements in Python?**  \n",
    "They control the flow of execution, allowing the program to make decisions based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. How does the `elif` statement work?**  \n",
    "It checks another condition if the previous `if` condition was false, before moving to `else`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. Difference between `for` and `while` loops?**  \n",
    "- **for** – Iterates over a sequence or range (known iterations).  \n",
    "- **while** – Runs until a condition becomes false (unknown iterations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. Scenario where `while` is more suitable?**  \n",
    "When waiting for an event or condition to occur, like reading input until a user types “exit”.\n"
